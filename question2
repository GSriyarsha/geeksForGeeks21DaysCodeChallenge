PROBLEM 2 : MAXIMUM GAP


Given an unsorted array. Your task is to find the maximum difference between the successive elements in its sorted form.

Input:
The first line of input contains an integer T,  number of test cases. Following T lines contains an integer N denoting the size of array and next line followed contains the array elements.

Output:
Print the maximum gap between the successive elements.

Constraints:
1 ≤ T ≤ 100
1 ≤ N ≤ 106
1 ≤ A[i] ≤ 106

Example:
Input:
1
3
1 10 5

Output:
5
